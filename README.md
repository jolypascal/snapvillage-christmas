SnapVillage Christmas Gingerbread Chalet
Welcome to the SnapVillage Christmas Gingerbread Chalet project! This repository contains the STL file for a 3D-printable gingerbread chalet designed to be assembled using 10x3mm magnets, allowing for a fun, festive, and reusable holiday decoration.
Project Description
This model is part of the SnapVillage collection, a series of printable, modular Christmas village houses. The unique design incorporates small magnets to snap the walls, roof, and base together securely without the need for glue.
Key Features
Modular Design: Easy assembly and disassembly.
Magnet Assembly: Uses readily available 10mm diameter, 3mm thick magnets (neodymium recommended).
Festive Decoration: A charming addition to any holiday display.
3D Printable: Optimized for FDM printing.
Files
snapvillage-christmasGingerbread_Chalet_10x3mm_magnets.stl: The primary STL file containing all parts of the chalet model.
Required Materials
To complete your gingerbread chalet, you will need the following:
3D Printer and Filament: PLA filament is recommended for ease of printing and material stability.
Magnets: Approximately 14 to 20 neodymium magnets measuring 10mm (diameter) x 3mm (thickness). The exact number depends on how many you use for the base and roof sections (ensure you have an even number for pairing).
Glue: A small amount of superglue or epoxy for securing the magnets into their designated slots.
Printing Instructions
The provided STL file includes all the necessary components laid out on a single print bed.
Recommended Print Settings:
Material: PLA
Layer Height: 0.2mm
Infill: 15% - 20%
Supports: No supports are generally needed for the main walls or base. The roof parts may benefit from minimal supports for the overhanging eaves, depending on your printer's bridging capabilities.
Orientation: Print the parts flat on the build plate as they are oriented in the file for best results.
Assembly Instructions
Print all parts: Ensure all components in the STL file are printed successfully.
Insert Magnets:
Identify the circular magnet slots on the edges of the walls, base, and roof sections.
Crucial Step: Before gluing, ensure you place the magnets with alternating polarity so that connecting pieces attract each other and do not repel. A good method is to place a magnet in one slot, then use a second magnet to "click" onto it (ensuring the correct orientation), and then glue the second magnet into the corresponding slot of the adjacent piece.
Use a dab of superglue to secure each magnet firmly in its slot.
Assemble the Chalet:
Snap the four walls together using the integrated magnets.
Attach the walls to the base.
Attach the two roof halves to each other and place them on top of the walls.
